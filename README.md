# PJS Manual Labels
 A relabel of the PJS singing corpus manually labeled by a human.
 
# Information
 This is a relabel of the [PJS singing corpus](https://sites.google.com/site/shinnosuketakamichi/research-topics/pjs_corpus?authuser=0) to fix the mistakes in the labels that come with the corpus. Only the singing samples are relabeled. The labels follow the HTK mono label format and were made using [vLabeler](https://github.com/sdercolin/vlabeler). The phoneme system used is still the same, except `cl` is also used for glottal stops.

# Remarks
 I am quite confident that I did not make any mistakes in my labels, and I made sure that they are very precise. If you do encounter an error though, feel free to send over a pull request to fix the label!
